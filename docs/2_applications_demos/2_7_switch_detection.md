## **Overview**

This application offers a graphical interface for users to run an object
detection demo using either CPU or GPU/NPU to perform inference on a video file.

## **Switch Detection Video**

### **Inference Engine and Algorithm**

![tfliteframework][tflite]

This application uses:

 * TensorFlow Lite as an inference engine [^1] ;
 * MobileNet as default algorithm [^2] .

More details on [eIQâ„¢][eiq] page.

### **Running Switch Detection Video**

1. Run the _Switch Detection Video_ demo using the following line:
```console
# pyeiq --run switch_video
```
2. Type on **CPU** or **GPU**/**NPU** in the terminal to switch between cores.

  * This result is below:
