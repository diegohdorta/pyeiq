= Welcome to PyeIQ

PyeIQ provides classes and scripts to manage the eIQ Samples Apps.

== Getting Started with PyeIQ

Before installing PyeIQ, ensure all dependencies are installed. Most of them are
common dependencies found in any _GNU/Linux Distribution_; package names will be
different, but it shouldn't be difficult to search using whatever package management
tool that's used by your distribution.

[NOTE]
====
The procedures described in this document target a GNU/Linux Distribution Ubuntu 18.04.
====

=== Software Requirements

. Install the following packages in the GNU/Linux system:
+
[source,console]
----
~# apt install python3 python3-pip
----
+
. Then, use _pip3_ tool to install the https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/[_Virtualenv_] tool:
+
[source,console]
----
~$ pip3 install virtualenv
----

=== Building the PyeIQ Package

. Clone the PyeIQ repository from CAF.
+
. Use _Virtualenv_ tool to create an isolated Python environment:
+
[source,console]
----
~/pyeiq$ virtualenv env
~/pyeiq$ source env/bin/activate
----
+
. Generate the wheel (_.whl_) file format:
+
[source,console]
----
(env) ~/pyeiq# python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
----
+
. Copy the wheel file to the board:
+
[source,console]
----
(env) ~/pyeiq$ scp dist/eiq-1.0-py3-none-any.whl root@<boards_IP>:~
----
+
[CAUTION]
====
Be careful on changing the _<boards_IP>_ for the actually IP Address.
====
+
. To deactivate the virtual environment:
+
[source,console]
----
(env) ~/pyeiq$ deactivate
~/pyeiq$
----

=== Deploy the PyeIQ Package

. Install the PyeIQ Wheel file in the board:
+
[source,console]
----
root@imx8qmmek:~# pip3 install eiq-1.0-py3-none-any.whl
----
+
. Check the installation by retrieving the version:
+
.. Start an interactive mode with Python3:
+
[source,console]
----
root@imx8qmmek:~# python3
----
+
.. Check the PyeIQ latest version:
+
[source,console]
----
>>> import eiq
>>> eiq.__version__
